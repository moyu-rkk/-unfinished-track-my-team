# Track My Team
My first original tiny project


## Project Background
~~or just call it user story~~

Well, as a football fan I was planning to make a really *simple* web APP to track my team's fixtures and position.

It looks like this:

I use Bootstrap 5 and flex layout to create responsive interface.


## Mission Break Down
All the things need to be done seems quite simple:
1. Get the option chosen by user
2. Find the corresponding team id
3. Use team id to customize URL and call ***API-FOOTBALL***
4. Sort and store the data return by API
5. Render new event boards
6. Save user chosen options to localStorage



I've completed this challenge on Mar 27, 2023!
